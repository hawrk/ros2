  By not providing "Findusb.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "usb", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "usb" with any of
  the following names:

    usbConfig.cmake
    usb-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "usb" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "usb_DIR"
  to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "usb" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
